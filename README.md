**Log Analysis Script**

This Python script processes log files to extract and analyze key information such as IP requests, endpoints, and suspicious activities. It is designed for cybersecurity-related tasks and demonstrates proficiency in file handling, string manipulation, and data analysis.

Detect Suspicious Activity\
Identifies brute force login attempts based on HTTP status codes (401) or failure messages like "Invalid credentials".\
Flags IPs exceeding a configurable threshold (default: 10 failed attempts).

**Output Results**

Saves results to a CSV file (log_analysis_results.csv) with sections for IP request counts, endpoint access counts, and suspicious activity detection.

**Requirements**
Python 3.7+
Required libraries: collections, re, csv
